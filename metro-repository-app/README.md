## Disclaimer
The datasets on Metro Data Warehouse are made available "as is" either by accessing open-source data repositories or provided to us by authors of research publications. 

We do our best to ensure that the data in the data warehouse is complete, accurate and useful. However, because the processing required to make the data useful is complex, we cannot be liable for omissions or inaccuracies.
